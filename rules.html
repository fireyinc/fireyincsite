       <h1><u>Rules:</u></h1>
       <p>These are VERY simple rules for this server. Just follow them, and nothing bad will happen. If you exploit them, we will ban you, or atleast remove as many of your perms as possible.</p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p>Rule 1: No walls or other borders should never be erected for personal grudges, or other malicious reasons. Land reservation borders can be made, but these borders have to be exactly <b>ONE</b> block tall.</p>
       <p>Rule 2: Slandering other people is not allowed for ANY reason. This means no exclusion, name-calling, or other forms of bullying.</p>
       <p>Rule 3: Claimed land cannot be used for ANY REASON by any other person(s) without permission of the land claimant(s).</p>
       <p>Rule 4: Unclaimed land is always considered free for use by anyone. If you complain about stolen land, and there is no border with signs explicitly stating that it was yours, your complaint will be void</p>
       <p>Rule 5: Unless if the issue is very large, like griefing, all issues wil be solved with a "trial". These trials will consist of the person(s) talking CALMLY about what happened, and why they did what they did.</p>
