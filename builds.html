    <h1><u>Notable Builds:</u></h1>
    <h2>Lake Knoll:</h2>
    <p>This is a small community to the left of the Spawn area. As the name suggests, this community is around a lake.</p>
    <p>There are many houses in the area, and a Post Ofice. There are also many empty plots where you can build a home of your own!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <h2>The Postal System:</h2>
    <p>The Postal System is exactly what is sounds like. It is based off a rail system. In the middle of the map (spawn), there is something known as the Post Hub.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here, the attendant sends mail out to all the stations, and when mail is recieved or being sent to a station, the attendant transfers it over from the first rail, and sends it to the next one.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It is infact a VERY simple rail based, underground postal system.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Galaxy Castle:</h2>
    <p>One of the first members on the server decided that he wanted to build a castle. He made an absolutely <b>GIGANTIC</b> set of walls, and filled it with a castle, and some smaller homes.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Netherite Tower:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>A gigantic netherite monolith that serves as one of the largest builds of the server. It's most notable feature is the Enderdragon cage at the top of the tower. You can kill the dragon using the instakill button located right next to it.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>More builds coming soon.</h2>
